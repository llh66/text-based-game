---the only one who still keep calm.Enraged, it roars and charges him.

the highest mountain on other side of the sea.At the beginning,the navigation is nice,the fresh air and the sea wind relax him.However,

death,but the adventurer finds the source of the storm---a Hydra.It says that it's a kind of mythical creature,having strong resilience.
